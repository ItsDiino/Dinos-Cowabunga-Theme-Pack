# Dino's Cowabunga Theme Pack

This is a little project for cowabunga users, right now it contains 12 themes but I might add more the future (prolly not though). I was planning to add more stuff like fonts and custom operations but I'll be making a misaka repo since it is easier to use and I really like the application and I also couldn't figure out how to port fonts to ios.

# Themes

1. Alive
2. BlackOrs
3. BlackWarm
4. Compacticons
5. Compacticons White
6. Felicity Pro
7. Fita
